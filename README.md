# DoorDash CLI

DoorDash CLI (`dd-cli`) is a terminal tool for ordering from DoorDash — search restaurants and stores, browse menus, build a cart, reorder a past order, and preview or check out — all from the command line. It's built to be driven directly by a human, or called by AI agents with shell access (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc.) so they can complete ordering tasks on your behalf.

> Waitlist-only. Full functionality requires an approved account. Join the waitlist here: https://forms.gle/gvCQZvu9C1EKA6aM6

Currently supported: **macOS, Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)**.

This repository also contains a community Linux rebuild workflow. It preserves
the official release's packaged Python application bytecode and replaces its
macOS-only runtime and keychain adapter with Linux equivalents. See
[Linux rebuild](#linux-rebuild) below.

## Download

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/doordash-oss/doordash-cli/releases) and open the latest release.
2. Download the `dd-cli-v<version>-darwin-arm64.tar.gz` asset.
3. Use the SHA256 checksum published on that release to verify the download.
4. Extract the tar.gz and follow the instructions in the `quickstart.txt`.

## Features
DoorDash CLI functionality will become available to you once you have gotten off the waitlist and have signed into a DoorDash account via dd-cli login.

The following subset of DoorDash features are currently supported:
- Addresses: list saved addresses, set the default address (must be a previously registered address)
- Payment methods: list saved payment methods (currently card-only)
- Store Search: search for stores (restaurant, grocery, and more) based on free-form query, find nearby stores, view store details
- Menu Search: browse menus/catalogs, search for specific items, view item details
- Cart management: list active carts, add/remove items, view cart contents, delete cart
  - Cart Types: Individual or Group
- Shopping list: Build cart from a shopping list
- Promotions: list eligible campaign promos for a store, apply/remove promo code
- Work benefits: apply company/employee payment budgets
- Ordering: preview order pricing, set tip amount, apply credits, submit orders (or get a browser checkout URL as fallback), check payment status, recreate a past order
  - Fulfillment modes: Pick-up or Delivery
  - Scheduling: ASAP or Schedule Ahead
  - Delivery Speed: Priority/Express or Standard
- Order history: view past orders and fetch receipts

## Security Notice

This binary is distributed as-is, without warranty of any kind. By downloading and executing it, you acknowledge that you are running third-party software obtained over the internet and assume all associated risks. We strongly recommend verifying the integrity of the downloaded file before use by comparing it against the published checksum associated with the release. Do not proceed if the computed checksum does not match.

To compute the checksum of your download:

```bash
shasum -a 256 dd-cli-v<version>-darwin-arm64.tar.gz
```

## Linux rebuild

On a 64-bit glibc 2.17+ Linux host (x86_64 or aarch64), run:

```bash
bash scripts/rebuild-linux.sh
```

The script selects the latest official macOS ARM64 release, verifies its
published SHA256 digest, extracts the architecture-neutral Python package,
recreates its exact dependency set on a matching Linux Python runtime, builds
a native executable against the manylinux2014 baseline, audits its bundled ELF
libraries, exercises its command surface and Linux Secret Service credential
path, and writes a binary plus installable archive under `dist/`. To rebuild a
specific release, pass its version:

```bash
bash scripts/rebuild-linux.sh 0.2.1
```

The resulting CLI requires an unlocked Secret Service-compatible desktop
keychain (for example GNOME Keyring). This matches the official CLI's rule that
OAuth credentials must use an operating-system keychain; no plaintext token
fallback is introduced.

## Try it

```bash
dd-cli --help
dd-cli search --query "ramen near me"
dd-cli order history
```
